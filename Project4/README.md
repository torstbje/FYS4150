# FYS4150
To run the code for this project, type 'python3 main.py' in the terminal. You will then get to choose whether you want ot measure against amount of cycles or temperature. If you choose number of cycles, you will get to choose temperature yourself. You will either way be able to choose the dimension of the lattice as well as the total number of montecarlo cycles performes. The temperature option does the given amount of Monte-Carlo cycles for each temperature, which is an array of values between 2 and 2.3 [kT/J].
