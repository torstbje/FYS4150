# FYS4150
To run the code for this project, run 'python3 main.py'. You will then get to choose the number of days you want the simulations to run and the number of measurement points. After this you'll see the menu where you can choose which system/algorithm you want to run/plot. Each of the options has a number from 1-9 and you simply type in the number corresponding to the system chosen. It is specified if Euler or Verlet is used. In this menu you also have the possibility to change the number of days and measurement points by typing '99', or to stop the program by typing '0'.

The 9th option calculates and prints the precession angle for Mercurys perihelion in addition to plotting the orbit, but we weren't able to find this solution. Here it will not matter what number of days you have chosen. It is set to one century.
